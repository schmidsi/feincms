This is an assorted list of stuff.


Internal variables FeinCMS uses:


request._feincms_applicationcontents
    Return value of an application content during a request/response cycle

request._feincms_applicationcontent_headers:
    Additional headers which can be set by an application content






The stages when processing a request

Now:

- Determination of Page instance
(- Collect application contents and process them)
- Render template
    - Collect and render content types
- Return response


Reworked:

- Determine Page instance
- Collect content type objects and render them
    - Collect media files etc. in the process
    - If any returns a special object (f.e. a HttpResponse) do something else
- Render template using pre-rendered content types
