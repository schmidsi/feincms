====================================
FeinCMS 1.3 release notes (upcoming)
====================================


Overview
========

FeinCMS 1.3 is mainly a cleanup release and does not sport many new features.


Backwards-incompatible changes
==============================

* The default ``ContentProxy`` has been refactored to load all content type
  instances on initialization. The instances stay around for the full
  request-response cycle which allows us to remove many quasi-global variables
  (variables attached to the ``request`` object).

* ``feincms_site`` is not available in the context anymore. It was undocumented,
  mostly unused and badly named anyway. If you still need this functionality you
  should use ``django.contrib.sites`` directly yourself.
